- vectorize training by providing training inputs and outputs as an array.
  - compare training speeds
- implement different neuron types and test against numeric
  - htan
  - max(x, 0)
- implement a better cost function

- refine input based on best guess of output, using backrop to X0
- try training multiple nets in parallel and taking majority output
  - can nets cross-train each other in in some kind of echo chamber?
  - can values from one net help form new nets that work well?
- try generating multiple random nets to find which one is best to start with
  or find which ones seem to train fastest
- try making a generative network for digits using mnist
